# odin-recipes
So I'm doing this Odin recipes project where I'm going to make a website which will contain recipes.

I'm going to make this website with what I've learned in this project which are :

1. Writing a HTML boilerplate
2. Using different tags like <ul> <li> <a> <img> etc.
3. Make links to other HTML pages in my directory
